Contains modules that read and save files in DICOM format within the Weasel GUI.

It also has the definition of classes that represent medical image objects/structures. Usually, a single DICOM file represents a 2D image within a scanning session. The classes defined in this module describe which DICOM files are part of them and their interactions and relationships between them. Some of these classes also contain functions that interact with the Weasel GUI.
