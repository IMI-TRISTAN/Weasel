# Description of Documents repository

This repository hosts the images and icons that are used by Weasel. This folder is also used to host temporary files when generating the documentation for the Github Page [here](https://qib-sheffield.github.io/WEASEL/). 

# Weasel Reference Manual

In order to automatically generate the API documentation for Weasel, simply run the python file `create_weasel_manual.py` in the parent folder.

There is a Github Action Workflow in place that updates the output reference manual at every commit/push/pull request to the master branch.
